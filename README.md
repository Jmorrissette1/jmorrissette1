**Building secure, production-ready systems on Azure | 19 years in IT | Currently: Launching an e-commerce platform with security-first architecture**

## About Me

I'm a cloud security engineer with 19 years of experience spanning infrastructure, development, and security operations. I specialize in **building secure cloud systems** with defense-in-depth architecture, automation, and Infrastructure as Code.

**Current Focus:**
- **Building in public:** Architecting and launching <a href="https://github.com/jasonmorrissette/print-and-deploy">Print and Deploy</a> a production e-commerce platform on Azure
- **Security-first design:** Implementing enterprise-grade security from day one, not bolting it on later
- **Cloud engineering:** Azure infrastructure, Terraform, serverless architecture, cost optimization
- **Security automation:** Python-based threat detection, compliance monitoring, and incident response

**What makes me different:**
My 19-year journey (Help Desk → Sysadmin → Network Engineer → Developer → Security) gives me **full-stack visibility** into how systems are built, deployed, secured, exploited, and defended. I don't just configure cloud platforms — I **engineer secure systems** with deep understanding of the entire stack.

## 🚀 Featured Project: Print and Deploy

**A security-first e-commerce platform built on Azure**

[🔗 View Project]([https://github.com/jasonmorrissette/print-and-deploy](https://github.com/Jmorrissette1/print-and-deploy)) | 📅 Launching March 2026

**What it demonstrates:**
- ✅ **Production infrastructure:** Real business processing actual payments
- ✅ **Security architecture:** Key Vault, RBAC, comprehensive audit logging, PCI compliance
- ✅ **Infrastructure as Code:** 100% Terraform, reproducible deployments
- ✅ **Cost optimization:** Running at ~$2/month using Azure free tiers
- ✅ **Polyglot development:** TypeScript (business logic) + Python (security automation)
- ✅ **Full documentation:** Architecture decisions, deployment logs, security design

**Tech Stack:**  
Azure (Key Vault, Functions, Cosmos DB, Static Web Apps) | Terraform | TypeScript | Python | Next.js | Stripe

**Security Highlights:**
- Defense-in-depth architecture designed from day one
- Zero secrets in code (all in Key Vault with RBAC)
- Automated threat detection (Python security functions)
- Comprehensive audit logging (90-day retention)
- PCI-compliant payment processing

> This isn't a tutorial project — it's a **real business** that doubles as a portfolio demonstrating production cloud security engineering.
